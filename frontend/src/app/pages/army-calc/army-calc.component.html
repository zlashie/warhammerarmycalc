                        This calculator is made with the purpose of gaining an overall understanding 
                        of your 2000p 10th edition Warhammer army, given an ideal boardstate. 
                        It answers the question "How does my army perform, if I get a turn where I
                        have 100% unit activations."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        There are some assumptions made to be able to generalize for this hollistic 
                        purpose. First, the wound distribution is done on a baseline of 4+, supplied
                        with a toughness distribution to see how different targets affect your 
                        units wound output. Similarly, the damage distribution is before saves, supplied 
                        with a save distribution to see how different targets affect your units 
                        damage output.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this analytical tool should help you understand better how your army performs, 
                        generally speaking, versus different target profiles, instead of relying on silver bullets
                        against usually feared targets such as Land Raiders, C'tans, Deathwing knights etc.
